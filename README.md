# kubernetes-secrets

Credentials provider for the credentials that reads Kubernetes secrets.
This allows you to define Kubernetes secrets, and they'll be available as credentials inside Jenkins.

The plugins requires that Jenkins runs inside Kubernetes.

This is a work in progress but the basics have already been achieved.

## Left to do

- Documentation
- Clean up
- Write tests

## Note
The code is messy as this was more of a proof of concept. The code needs to be cleaned up and then packaged up.
